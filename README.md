Symmetric vs Asymmetric 🔐



 I break down the core principles of data encryption and demonstrate how both classical and modern encryption techniques work using:



✅ Caesar Cipher – A classical symmetric method

✅ AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) – A modern symmetric encryption algorithm

✅ RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) – A powerful asymmetric encryption system



Whether you're a beginner in cybersecurity or brushing up on the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) standards, this practical walkthrough will help you understand how data can be secured in transit and at rest.
